Whenever I feel like messing around with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Maybe also other JavaScript stuff in the future.

## why?
I got my start in programming with Khan Academy's JavaScript course, which used Processing.js. In an art class, the prompt was to create something "inspired by science". This is what came to mind.

### no, like, why make *this?*
I used to use OpenProcessing. But then I found out they do NFTs. And that's something I can't support.

## how?
Put sketches in [`/sketches/`](/sketches), start the name of the file with a year (used to group sketches). Run `node .` to create a sketches.mjs. Serve on a server.

## contributing
No contributions to [`/sketches/`](/sketches) will be accepted (unless it's a severe or security issue, or something). This repo is more of a showcase than anything.  
Other files are fair game.
